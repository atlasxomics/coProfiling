# coProfiling
This repository is to generate the reports from analysis of the comapping of the epigenome and transcriptome by simultaneous profiling of chromatin accessibility and messenger RNA expression (spatial assay for transposase-accessible chromatin and RNA using sequencing (spatial ATAC–RNA-seq)), or histone modifications and mRNA expression (spatial CUT&Tag–RNA-seq)
